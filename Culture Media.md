## RPMI Medium for HCC1937, LNCaP, 4T1 cells (500 mL)

**<span style="color:#1E90FF;">Materials:</span>**
- RPMI medium  
- Pen/Strep (5 ml)  
- Fetal Bovine Serum (50 ml)  
- Bottle top filter  

1) Place RPMI medium, Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), and Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) in 37°C water bath until medium is warm to the touch and P/S & FBS have completely thawed. Note: Intermittent vortexing of P/S and FBS will help them thaw faster.  
2) <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">NOTE: Always make sure chemicals have thawed completely before using them. You never know how much chemical is trapped inside the ball of ice.</span>  
3) All the following procedures must take place under the cell culture hood using aseptic techniques.  
4) Make sure the cell culture hood is clean by spraying the cell culture hood base (floor) with 70% ethanol (EtOH) and wiping it clean with a paper towel.  
5) Sterilize bottle top filter packaging, RPMI medium, P/S, and FBS by spraying 70% EtOH on each and rubbing the outside walls of each with gloved hands and place them inside the cell culture hood.  
6) Remove bottle top filter from its packaging (inside the hood) and set it up as seen in this image (left):  

![[Pasted image 20250921220835.png]]

7) These have all been sterilized and so it is imperative that you are very careful when pipetting or pouring them.  
8) Pour 500 mL of RPMI into the funnel of the bottle top filter.  
9) Pipette 5 mL of P/S (1%) and 50 mL of FBS (10%) into the 500 mL of RPMI that is already in the funnel.  
10) Place the funnel lid back on the funnel.  
11) Carefully connect the vacuum hose to the hose connector and turn the vacuum pump on.  
12) Wait patiently for the complete medium to pass through the membrane and collect within the sterile receiver bottle.  
13) Remove the funnel and place the provided cap on the sterile receiver bottle.  
14) Label the sterile receiver bottle with your name, contents, type of cells this is for, and date. Note: for contents use **RPMI/c**. The “c” stands for complete, meaning you have added all the required supplements (P/S and FBS).  
15) Store @ 4°C. For long term storage, store at -20°C.
